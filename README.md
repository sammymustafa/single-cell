# Single Cell RNA-Seq Analysis: Clustering and Differential Gene Expression in Alzheimer's Disease

Here, I focus on Single Cell RNA-Seq analysis to explore cellular heterogeneity in Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Utilizing advanced clustering techniques like t-SNE and UMAP, this study aims to dissect the complex landscape of gene expression at the single-cell level. By identifying marker genes and conducting differential gene expression analysis, I delve into the molecular distinctions between various AD conditions, shedding light on the underlying biological processes.

## Key Highlights
### 1. Clustering with t-SNE and UMAP
* Objective: Perform high-dimensional data analysis to cluster single cells based on their gene expression profiles.
* Methods:
  * t-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding): This technique helps visualize high-dimensional data by reducing it to two or three dimensions, preserving the local structure of the data.
  * UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection): An alternative to t-SNE, UMAP also reduces dimensionality while maintaining the global data structure, often resulting in clearer separation of clusters.
* Analysis: Applying these methods, we clustered cells from AD patients, revealing distinct cellular subpopulations and highlighting the heterogeneity within the disease.

### 2. Identification of Marker Genes
* Objective: Discover specific genes that are uniquely expressed in different cell clusters, serving as markers for cellular identity.
* Method: Analyzed gene expression data to identify marker genes for each cluster, providing insights into the functional roles of different cell types in AD.
* Outcome: This step was crucial for characterizing the identified clusters and understanding the cellular composition in the context of Alzheimer's Disease.

### 3. Differential Gene Expression Analysis
* Objective: Investigate the differences in gene expression between various conditions of Alzheimer's Disease.
* Method: Conducted a comprehensive differential gene expression analysis between identified cell clusters.
* Findings: This analysis highlighted key genes and pathways that are differentially regulated in AD, offering valuable insights into the disease's pathophysiology.
  
## Conclusion: Insights into Alzheimer's Disease Pathology
Overall, the single-cell RNA-Seq analysis provides a detailed view of the cellular landscape in Alzheimer's Disease. Through clustering techniques like t-SNE and UMAP, along with the identification of marker genes and differential gene expression analysis, this study has uncovered significant molecular characteristics of AD. These insights deepen our understanding of the disease at the cellular level and open up new avenues for research into potential therapeutic targets.
